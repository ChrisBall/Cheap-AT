 Repository for cheap Accessible Tech and Accessible Music Tech

 Currently seeking help to develop and improve these repositories.

 Switch Hub - Contains files necessary to reproduce an 8-input HID MIDI switch hub, based on the XIAO ESP32S3 dev board. This means you can connect accessibility switches to this box and plug it into your computer, and you'll get musical MIDI data when you press the attached switches.

 Quick Switch - A simple design for a 3D printed accessibility switch (developed in OpenSCAD) that is made of 3 parts: a top; a base; and a PCB. The design is durable and extremely cheap to manufacture, although could stand to be improved; the switch requires different levels of pressure depending on where you press it.


 Desired Improvements:
 
 - Multiple switch hub firmware types for different purposes (keyboard/gamepad/joystick emulation) with a simple user interface for configuration, or a single multipurpose firmware with easy configuration.
 - Cheaper hardware for the switch hub - I am currently using a XIAO ESP32S3 as it provides battery management and allows for future wireless/BLE versions, but there may be a cheaper dev board or bespoke hardware.
